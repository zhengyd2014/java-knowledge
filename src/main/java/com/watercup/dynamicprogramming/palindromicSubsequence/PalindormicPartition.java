    /*
    Given a string, we want to cut it into pieces such that each piece is a palindrome.
    Write a function to return the minimum number of cuts needed.

    Example 1:

    Input: "abdbca"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "a", "bdb", "c", "a".
    Example 2:

    Input: = "cddpd"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "c", "d", "dpd".
    Example 3:

    Input: = "pqr"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "p", "q", "r".
    Example 4:

    Input: = "pp"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: We do not need to cut, as "pp" is a palindrome.
